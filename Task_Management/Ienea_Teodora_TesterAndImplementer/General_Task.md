# **General Task**

### **Task Overview**

The main task for the Tester and Implementer is twofold:  

1. Develop automated tests that execute each time the vehicle starts, ensuring all physical components are functioning within optimal parameters.  
2. Handle the implementation of the main system, integrating the software modules with the hardware. This includes bridging the user interface (e.g., a mobile app) and the development board via Bluetooth communication, enabling seamless control and interaction.
