# **General Task**

### **Task Overview**

The main task for the Algorithm Designer is to develop algorithms using the predefined functions created by the Embedded Programmer. These algorithms must enable the following functionalities:  

1. Tracking the object in front of the vehicle.  
2. Performing parallel parking in reverse.  
3. Executing parallel parking while moving forward.  
4. Ensuring the vehicle avoids collisions from all sides.  
5. Allowing forward movement while avoiding obstacles behind.  
6. Implementing any additional functions required as the project progresses.  

These algorithms should be efficient, modular, and adaptable for seamless integration into the system.
